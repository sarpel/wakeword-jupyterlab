# üîä Background Noise Samples

**Environmental noise recordings for robust wakeword detection training**

## üéØ Purpose

This directory contains background noise recordings that simulate real-world
acoustic environments. These samples are mixed with positive and negative
samples during training to create more robust models that work well in noisy
conditions.

### Minimum Requirements

- **Files**: 1000+ recordings (5000+ recommended)
- **Duration**: 1-10 seconds per recording (variable lengths OK)
- **Format**: WAV, MP3, FLAC, M4A, or OGG
- **Content**: Environmental noise WITHOUT speech
