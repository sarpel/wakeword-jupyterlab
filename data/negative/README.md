# ‚ùå Negative Samples - Non-Wakeword Speech

**Diverse speech recordings that do NOT contain the wakeword**

## üéØ Purpose

This directory contains negative examples - speech recordings that do NOT
contain your wakeword. These samples teach the model to distinguish between
wakeword and regular speech, preventing false positives.

## üìä Requirements

### Minimum Requirements

- **Files**: 450+ recordings (2000+ recommended)
- **Duration**: 1-3 seconds per recording (variable lengths OK)
- **Format**: WAV, MP3, FLAC, M4A, or OGG
- **Content**: Speech WITHOUT wakeword instances

### Directory Structure

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Content Issues

- **Including Wakeword**: Even accidental instances can harm training
- **Too Similar**: Words that sound very similar to wakeword
- **Insufficient Variety**: Limited speaker or content diversity
- **Poor Quality**: Distorted, clipped, or noisy recordings
- **Wrong Language**: Primarily non-target language speech

## üöÄ Automated Processing

### Using the Automated System

1. Place all negative recordings in `negative/` folder
2. Click **"Detect Dataset Status"** in the application
3. Click **"Auto-Split Dataset"** to organize files
4. Verify distribution with **"Get Dataset Info"**

### Manual Verification

```bash
# Count total files
ls negative/*.wav | wc -l

# Check for wakeword instances (manual review required)
# Listen to random samples to verify content
# Ensure good variety across files
```

## üìà Performance Impact

### Good Negative Dataset

- **Low False Positives**: Minimal incorrect wakeword detection
- **High Precision**: Accurate wakeword identification
- **Robust Performance**: Works across different speech contexts
- **Speaker Independence**: Not biased to specific speakers
- **Environment Resilience**: Handles various acoustic conditions

### Poor Negative Dataset

- **High False Positives**: Regular speech triggers wakeword detection
- **Poor Precision**: Many incorrect positive predictions
- **Overfitting**: Poor generalization to new speech contexts
- **Speaker Bias**: Performance varies significantly across speakers
- **Environment Sensitivity**: Poor performance in new acoustic environments

## üîß Advanced Tips

### Dataset Balance

- **Quantity**: More negative samples than positive (4:1 ratio recommended)
- **Diversity**: Greater diversity in negative samples
- **Context Coverage**: Cover all contexts where wakeword might appear
- **Temporal Variety**: Include speech from different time periods
- **Source Diversity**: Mix of different recording sources and conditions

### Quality Enhancement

- **Consistent Processing**: Apply same preprocessing to all files
- **Noise Management**: Consistent approach to background noise
- **Volume Normalization**: Consistent loudness levels
- **Format Standardization**: Use consistent audio format
- **Metadata**: Maintain recording source and context information

### Collection Strategy

- **Systematic Collection**: Plan collection across different contexts
- **Regular Updates**: Add new samples based on performance feedback
- **User Feedback**: Incorporate real-world false positive examples
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly review and enhance dataset
- **Bias Testing**: Test for biases across different user groups
